  # Create Anton profile with simplified authentication

  1. Clean Up
    - Remove existing anton entries to start fresh
    
  2. Create Anton Profile
    - Create anton user with simple credentials
    - Set as owner with proper stats
    - Use simple password hashing
    
  3. Fix RLS Policies
    - Simplify user_sessions policies to allow login
    - Remove restrictive checks that prevent authentication
