  # Fix RLS policies for room_users table

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies on room_users table
    - Create new permissive policies that allow users to join rooms
    - Ensure INSERT operations work for both authenticated and anonymous users
    - Maintain read access for all users

  2. Changes Made
    - Remove existing INSERT policy that may be too restrictive
    - Add new INSERT policy with proper permissions
    - Keep existing SELECT policy for reading room users
    - Add UPDATE policy for user management if needed

  This fixes the RLS violation error when users try to join chat rooms.
